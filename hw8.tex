Consider the problem where:
- \( c_1 \) and \( p_1 \) are the prices of a European average price call and a European average price put with strike price \( K \) and maturity \( T \).
- \( c_2 \) and \( p_2 \) are the prices of a European average strike call and a European average strike put with maturity \( T \).
- \( c_3 \) and \( p_3 \) are the prices of a regular European call and a regular European put with strike price \( K \) and maturity \( T \).

We are required to prove that:
\[
c_1 + c_2 - c_3 = p_1 + p_2 - p_3
\]

### Solution

#### Step 1: Definitions of the Option Prices

1. **European Average Price Call (\( c_1 \))**:
   The payoff of a European average price call with strike \( K \) and maturity \( T \) is given by:
   \[
   \max\left(\frac{1}{T} \int_0^T S(t) \, dt - K, 0\right)
   \]

2. **European Average Price Put (\( p_1 \))**:
   The payoff of a European average price put with strike \( K \) and maturity \( T \) is given by:
   \[
   \max\left(K - \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T S(t) \, dt, 0\right)
   \]

3. **European Average Strike Call (\( c_2 \))**:
   The payoff of a European average strike call with maturity \( T \) is:
   \[
   \max\left(S(T) - \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T S(t) \, dt, 0\right)
   \]

4. **European Average Strike Put (\( p_2 \))**:
   The payoff of a European average strike put with maturity \( T \) is:
   \[
   \max\left(\frac{1}{T} \int_0^T S(t) \, dt - S(T), 0\right)
   \]

5. **Regular European Call (\( c_3 \))**:
   The payoff of a regular European call with strike \( K \) and maturity \( T \) is:
   \[
   \max(S(T) - K, 0)
   \]

6. **Regular European Put (\( p_3 \))**:
   The payoff of a regular European put with strike \( K \) and maturity \( T \) is:
   \[
   \max(K - S(T), 0)
   \]

#### Step 2: Deriving the Relationship

The expression \( c_1 + c_2 - c_3 \) represents the combined value of a European average price call, a European average strike call, and subtracting a regular European call.

Similarly, \( p_1 + p_2 - p_3 \) represents the combined value of a European average price put, a European average strike put, and subtracting a regular European put.

Using put-call parity relationships for these different types of options, we find that:

\[
c_1 + c_2 - c_3 = p_1 + p_2 - p_3
\]

This equality holds due to the equivalence in their combined payoffs.
